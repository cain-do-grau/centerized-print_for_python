#substitute every print with centerize
#!! not everything will work as expected!!
#if it doesn't work use the normal print like this
#print((" " * (118 - (|the rounded number of digits in the sentence|/2))) + |and the sentence you are going to print|)
def centerize(B): 
  var0 = len(B)/2
  var00 = " " * (118 - round(var0))
  print(var00 + B)
